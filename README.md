The Quantum Aether Framework (QAF) introduces a formal architectural model for understanding reality as an integrated, information-governed system. Rather than advancing a single theory or experimental claim, the framework establishes a shared ontological foundation intended to organize and relate multiple domains of inquiry, including physics, cosmology, biology, consciousness studies, linguistics, and information systems.

QAF consolidates and contextualizes prior domain-specific work—such as Quantum Aether Physics, Quantum Aether Science, Quantum Aether Cosmology, and Terra Quantum Aether—within a coherent hierarchy of laws, principles, and inheritance relationships. It defines how concepts such as coherence, entropy, resonance, and informational constraint operate consistently across scales, from fundamental structure to complex systems.
